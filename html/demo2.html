  We'll create the same map as in demo1.html (position of Gwen in pre-searing, 
  but this time, we do it manually. It's not as easy as you would think.

         // the Google Map itself has already been created. In fact, most likely
         // it hasn't. The reason for this is that before we can do that, we 
         // have to load a database of  available maps. This is done dynamically 
         // via Ajax. So, before we continue, we have to wait for that to complete.

         // until either MAP_INDEX_LOADED or MAP_INDEX_FAILED is True. In the latter
         // case we can't do anything.
         // To make things easier, we can use GWMap.waitForDatabase(). But wait, 
         // there's one more thing to look out for! The callback closure will be
         // executed through setTimeout(), and thus loses the local context.  To
